Description: IRT classification uses the probability that candidates of
    a given ability, will answer correctly questions of a specified
    difficulty to calculate the probability of their achieving
    every possible score in a test. Due to the IRT assumption of
    conditional independence (that is every answer given is assumed
    to depend only on the latent trait being measured) the
    probability of candidates achieving these potential scores can
    be expressed by multiplication of probabilities for item
    responses for a given ability. Once the true score and the
    probabilities of achieving all other scores have been
    determined for a candidate the probability of their score lying
    in the same category as that of their true score
    (classification accuracy), or the probability of consistent
    classification in a category over administrations
    (classification consistency), can be calculated.
